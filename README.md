# MSDS6306_CaseStudyI:  Country GDP and Income Level Data

The objective of the assignment was to create a reproducible project using R, GitHub, and Git.  Two datasets from The Data World Bank website were downloaded consisting of the 2012 global GDP(Gross Domestic Product) and ranking by country dataset and the global education data set that specifically contained income levels by country.  The two datasets were downloaded, cleaned, and merged. An analysis of the data was completed requiring the use of the short country codes, GDP, and Income.Group columns.
